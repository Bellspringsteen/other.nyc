Dear Records Access Officer:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to me:
A document detailing the additional cost, over a no bicycle infrastructure street associated, with the construction of a unit (whatever the easiest unit is such as per block, per foot, etc) of a “Protected Bicycle Path with Access Point“  such as can be found on Columbus Avenue and 92nd Street.
A document detailing the cost associated, over a no bicycle infrastructure street associated, with the construction of a unit (whatever the easiest unit is such as per block, per foot, etc) of a “Bicycle Lane” such as can be found on 111th street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr Blvd.
Any documents detailing the proposal, construction, cost, or any other details of the installation of the “Protected Bicycle Path with Access Point“ which stretches from 110th to 69th street on Columbus Avenue in Manhattan.
Any documents detailing the proposal, construction, cost, or any other details of the installation of the “Bicycle Lane“ which stretches from 110th to 118thth street on Adam Clayton Powell Jr Blvd in Manhattan.

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. 

I ask that the data be provided in an Excel spreadsheet, csv or other delimited text file or other database format. If you have this information in an existing report, that may suffice.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,
 
Alex Bell
