Dear Records Access Officer:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to me:
A document containing a list of the number of NYPD employees who work in each precinct and the number of employees in the precinct who are signed up for the TransitBennefit Program. Each of these should be by Precinct.(http://www.nyc.gov/html/opa/html/transportation_benefits/premium_transitchek_metrocard_plan_info.shtml)

|Number of Employees | Number of Employees in TransitBennefit Program | Precinct |
|---|---|--|
|35 |31 |32nd|
|44| 40|28th|

	As you can see, there is no personally identifiable or other information included or required in this request.

If the above request is too laborious to collate, please provide the number of current NYPD employees who are enrolled in the TransitBennefit Program and how many are not. 

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. 

I ask that the data be provided in an Excel spreadsheet, csv or other delimited text file or other database format. If you have this information in an existing report, that may suffice.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,
 
Alex Bell
