New York City Office of Payroll Administration
1 Centre St.
New York, NY 10007

Dear Records Access Officer:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
I request that a copy of the following documents [or documents containing the following information] be provided to me:
A document specifying the current number of employees paid by the New York City Office of Payroll Administration and the number of these employees who are enrolled in the TransitBennefit Program.
A document specifying the number of employees who are paid by the New York City Office of Payroll Administration separated by the most granular level of the agency or division which the employees work for and of those employees the number who are enrolled in the TransitBennefit Program.

In order to help to determine my status to assess fees, you should know that I am an individual seeking information for personal use and not for a commercial use.

I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. 

I ask that the data be provided in an Excel spreadsheet, csv or other delimited text file or other database format. If you have this information in an existing report, that may suffice.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,
 
Alex Bell
